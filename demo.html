  For a simple demo of how Churchroad can utilize equality saturation for
  interesting EDA tasks, we will demonstrate how we can use it to decompile a
  half
  adder.
</p>
<p>
  The following mess of code is a simple example of what might come out of a
  synthesis tool like Yosys:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>
module top(i_a, i_b, o_s, o_c);
  wire \fa1.ha1_carry ;
  wire \fa1.ha1_sum ;
  wire \fa1.ha2_carry ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder1.i1 ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder1.i2 ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder1.o_carry ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder1.o_sum ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder2.i1 ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder2.i2 ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder2.o_carry ;
  wire \fa1.half_adder2.o_sum ;
  wire \fa1.i_a ;
  wire \fa1.i_b ;
  wire \fa1.i_c ;
  wire \fa1.o_c ;
  wire \fa1.o_s ;
  input i_a;
  wire i_a;
  input i_b;
  wire i_b;
  output o_c;
  wire o_c;
  output o_s;
  wire o_s;
  assign \fa1.o_c = \fa1.ha1_carry | \fa1.ha2_carry ;
  assign \fa1.ha1_carry = i_a & i_b;
  assign \fa1.half_adder1.o_sum = i_a ^ i_b;
  assign \fa1.ha2_carry = \fa1.half_adder1.o_sum & 1'h0;
  assign \fa1.half_adder2.o_sum = \fa1.half_adder1.o_sum ^ 1'h0;
  assign \fa1.o_s = \fa1.half_adder2.o_sum ;
  assign \fa1.i_c = 1'h0;
  assign \fa1.i_b = i_b;
  assign \fa1.i_a = i_a;
  assign \fa1.ha1_sum = \fa1.half_adder1.o_sum ;
  assign \fa1.half_adder2.i1 = \fa1.half_adder1.o_sum ;
  assign \fa1.half_adder2.i2 = 1'h0;
  assign \fa1.half_adder2.o_carry = \fa1.ha2_carry ;
  assign \fa1.half_adder1.i1 = i_a;
  assign \fa1.half_adder1.i2 = i_b;
  assign \fa1.half_adder1.o_carry = \fa1.ha1_carry ;
  assign o_c = \fa1.o_c ;
  assign o_s = \fa1.half_adder2.o_sum ;
endmodule

<p>
  If you <b>paste this code into the Churchroad demo and hit
    "Convert Verilog"</b> Churchroad will convert the Verilog to its internal
  representation: a
  domain-specific language embedded in the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog">egglog</a> language. This
  gives us a representation of the design which we can manipulate using the
  power of
  equality saturation.
</p>

<p>
  What might we want to do with equality saturation, however? One thing we might
  want is to see if we can discover places in the module where higher-level
  modules might have been used. For example, given the presence of bitwise ANDs
  and XORs in the above design, might there be a half adder buried in there?
</p>

<p>
  To explore this question, we write a rewrite rule which searches for specific
  patterns of ANDs and XORs and maps them back to higher-level Verilog modules:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
(ruleset adders)
(rule
 ; These are the things we are searching for. In this case, we are looking for
 ; wires a and b, both of which are inputs to an XOR and an AND gate.
 ((= sum (Op2 (Xor) a b))
  (= carry (Op2 (And) a b)))
 ; If we find the above wires, then we apply the following actions.
 ; Namely, using `union`, we say that the sum wire is *equivalent to* the "sum"
 ; output of a "HalfAdd" module instance, and the carry wire is likewise
 ; equivalent to the "carry" output of the same module instance.
 ((union sum
    (GetOutput 
      (ModuleInstance "HalfAdd" 
        (StringCons "a" (StringCons "b" (StringNil))) 
        (ExprCons a (ExprCons b (ExprNil)))) 
      "sum"))
  (union carry
    (GetOutput 
      (ModuleInstance "HalfAdd" 
        (StringCons "a" (StringCons "b" (StringNil)))
        (ExprCons a (ExprCons b (ExprNil))))
      "carry")))
  :ruleset adders)
(run-schedule (saturate adders))
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  If you <b>paste this rule below the generated Churchroad code and hit
    "Run"</b>,
  Churchroad will run the rule and compile the resulting egraph back to Verilog.
  In this case, you will see that Churchroad is able to decompile the big blob
  of Verilog into a much simpler half adder module instantiation!
</p>

<p>
  If you would like to continue exploring what Churchroad can do, try writing
  and running your own rewrite rules to transform the underlying design. You can
  see the results of your transformations in the egraph visualization in the
  bottom right. For even more exploration, you can try beginning with your very
  own Verilog modules.
</p>

<p>
  Churchroad is in the earliest stages of its development, so expect it to break
  very quickly. Please submit any issues via the "Submit Issue" button on the
  demo.

<p>
  Enjoy!
